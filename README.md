# GAN-Generative-adversarial-network-
Project Description
This project explores the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize images closely resembling handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Using PyTorch, the project tackles the intricate dynamics between the generator and the discriminator components of the GAN, aiming to perfect the generative process.
Repository Contents
- `evaluation.py`: Contains the evaluation metrics and visualization code for assessing the quality of generated images.
- `training.py`: Includes the training routines for both the generator and the discriminator.
- `generator.pt`: Saved model state for the generator.
- `generator_weights.pt`: Saved weights for the generator.
Project Report Summary
The project report, titled 'Image Generation with GAN', details the architectural setup, experimentation, and optimization techniques used to refine the GAN model. Key points include:
• GAN Architecture: A detailed explanation of the roles of the generator and the discriminator.
• Experiments: Description of various tests conducted to optimize the learning rate, batch size, and model complexity.
• Results: Insightful analysis of the generated images and loss plots, demonstrating the model's ability to produce realistic MNIST-like digits.
